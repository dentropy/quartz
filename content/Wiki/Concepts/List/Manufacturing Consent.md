Notes
-----

The public likes to think they have control over their government and desires but in reality the media acts as a tool to manufacture the atitudes of the public.

Examples are Listerine inventing Halitosis, a medical condition where someone has bad breath but other examples are much more sinister like the Vietnam War.

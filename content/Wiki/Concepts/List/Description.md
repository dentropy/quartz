# ELI5 Description
Problem:

I can not define simple words or ideas and concepts off the top of my head. What is a computation? What is a system? Who was Ayn Rand? What is Daemon by Daniel Suarez about? What is the Technological Singularity? What is Science? ELI5 (Explain Like I am Five) is an attempt to create my own personal dictionary.

Goal:Â 

Vision:

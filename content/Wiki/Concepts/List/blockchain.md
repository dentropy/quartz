* "Blockchains are permissionless distributed ledgers of transactions in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network where information (not necessarily financial) is recorded in a timely, secure, and tamper-resistant way. They exist and can be trusted because of mass collaboration, consensus, and code, not traditional intermediaries. They enable programmable scarce digital assets for virtually all forms of value."

    *   **Ideology**, a form of social or [political philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-philosophy) in which practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones. It is a system of ideas that aspires both to explain the world and to change it.

    *   _ideology_ has been from its inception a word with a marked emotive content
    *   ideology may mean any kind of action-oriented theory or any attempt to approach politics in the light of a system of ideas. Ideology in the stricter sense stays fairly close to Destutt de Tracy’s original [conception](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conception) and may be identified by five characteristics: (1) it contains an explanatory theory of a more or less [comprehensive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprehensive) kind about human experience and the external world; (2) it sets out a program, in generalized and abstract terms, of social and political organization; (3) it conceives the realization of this program as entailing a struggle; (4) it seeks not merely to persuade but to recruit loyal adherents, demanding what is sometimes called commitment; (5) it addresses a wide public but may tend to confer some special role of leadership on [intellectuals](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectuals). In this article the noun _ideology_ is used only in its strict sense; the adjective _ideological_ is used to refer to ideology as broadly defined.
    *   Ideologies and religions are total systems

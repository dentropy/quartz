User Story Research

As a [user type] I want [action], so that [benefit / value].

So an example of this for hive might be:

"As a competitive gamer, I want to see leaderboards on tournament pages so that I can compare myself to others more easily."

or

"As an event spectator, I want streams to be more easily accessible so I can watch my friends play in tournaments"

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.

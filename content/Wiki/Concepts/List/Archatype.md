# ELI5: Archatype
From [12 Rules For Life](../Media%20Consumption/Books/Book%20Notes/12%20Rules%20For%20Life.md)

It is for this reason that the Christian sacrificial drama of Son and Self is archetypal. It’s a story at the limit, where nothing more extreme—nothing greater—can be imagined. That’s the very definition of “archetypal.” That’s the core of what constitutes “religious.”

* Just like the star schema but the dimension tables have additional dimension tables.
* [wiki.concepts.list.schema.Star](Star.md) Schema is a special, simplified case of the snowflake schema.
* [wiki.concepts.list.schema.Star](Star.md) schema does not allow for one to many relationships while the snowflake schema does.
* Snowflake schema is more normalized than Star schema but only in 1NF or 2NF

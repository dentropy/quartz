## Summary

* Are you a mind with a body or a body with a mind. Are the body and mind two separate things?
* How can a non physical mind have any interaction with a physical body?
* If the mind is immaterial, why does your mind move only your body and not others.
* [wiki.concepts.list.Materialisim](Materialists) reject that there is any distinction between mind and body
* The [wiki.concepts.list.Rubber Hand Illusion](Rubber%20Hand%20Illusion.md) and similar VR experiments show us that our senses can easily mislead us in our judgement of self.
  * They also suggest that our bodies and external sensations are inseparable from our subjective consciousness
* If we close our eyes in a silent room having a body is not something we can imagine away
* How can we be sure we are communicating our subjective experiences accurately?
* We perceive our identity as separate from our bodies.
  * We feel misrepresented by our bodies.
  * The only way we can interact with others is through our bodies therefore people make assumptions about us based on our bodies.
  * What can we infer about a person by the way they look and the body the drive?

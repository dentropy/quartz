# Q. E. D. QED
QED - -"quod erat demonstrandum", literally meaning "what was to be shown".\[1\] Traditionally, the abbreviation is placed at the end of a mathematical proof or philosophical argument in print publications to indicate that the proof or the argument is complete, and hence is used with the meaning "thus it has been demonstrated".

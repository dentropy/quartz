    * Background and mini life history
      * Jay's parents moved to Canada when he was 8 years old. He quickly picked up the language and acceled in school. Jay's friends in high school were always of the smart variety. Jay now wonders if his parents had a stake in who he decided to be friends with but that is neither her or now. Jay then went to university for math where he was always able to focus and get his work done on time never requiring extensions, though proof reading would have helped. Jay is now a knowledge worker working as a data scientist.
    * Day in the life
      * As a data scientist Jay works from home having to attend daily standups at 10:00am where he and his team go through issues and successes they had on the previous day's projects and tickets. This is where Jay gets to compare himself to his competition.

* How does the Product make it easier for the Avatar to implement the Solution and achieve their Dream State?

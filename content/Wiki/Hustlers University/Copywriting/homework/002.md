## #Questions

* Who do you think the ideal target market for this product is?
  * Anybody that requires more focus in their life or has a problem with convergent thinking. Though I bet the nootropic helps with divergent thinking as well.
* Create an Avatar that embodies the target market you determined. List out some of their qualities.
  * See [](Our%20Avatar%7Cwiki.Hustlers%20University.Copyrighting.homework.002#our-avatar) below

* What is the key Roadblock keeping your Avatar from achieving their Dream State now?
  * See [](Our%20Avatar%7Cwiki.Hustlers%20University.Copyrighting.homework.002#our-avatar) below
* What is the Solution that will allow the Avatar to achieve their Dream State?
  * Nootropics work best inside healthy people therefore out Avatar has to be healthy. They are currently putting on some weight because of bad eating habits and not working out enough. Once the avatar starts their path towards a healthy lifestyle they can enhance their abilities with the nootropics.
* How does the Product make it easier for the Avatar to implement the Solution and achieve their Dream State?
  * Additional focus will allow the avatar to work more efficiently (more [wiki.concepts.list.Deep Work](../../../Concepts/List/Deep%20Work.md)) giving them more free time
  * Nootropics should allow the avatar to spend less time recovering from deep work allowing more deep work dessions 
  * I would imagine nootropics would enhance someones self awareness therefore the avatar can get their priorities strait.

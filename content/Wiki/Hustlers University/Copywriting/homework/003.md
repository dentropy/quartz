How do they establish trust with the reader?

* Appeal to authority (check the references at the bottom)
* Quotes from other people, neutrality
* It is native advertizing, advertizing disguised as a objective product review
* People desire a magical solution to their problems. People want to take fat loss pills rather than actually working out. This product is positioned as a brain booster rather than having people actually being required to use their will power.

What ways could this company increase LTV (Lifetime Total Value)?

* Talk about how the product applies to all age groups, for example there has to be scientific papers talking about the benefits of nootropics in senior citizens.
* They could appear less bias by mentioning and comparing to other nootropic brands such as First Person, and Alpha Brain building additional trust with the end user. Though this does work as a double edge sword sending users to their competitors. But big audacious moves like that build a more in depth relationship.

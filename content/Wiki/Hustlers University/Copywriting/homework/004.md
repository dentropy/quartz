### Goal

Good nutrition is required for nootropics to be effective. Let's first do some [wiki.concepts.list.nutrition](../../../../../MyDendronExistence/Health/Nutrition.md) research.

Research the [wiki.concepts.list.nootropics](../../../Concepts/List/nootropics.md) market starting with the following article ["This scientifically-balanced focus pill is the closest thing to inspiration in a bottle | Neurohacker Collective"](https://neurohacker.com/qualia-mind-essentials-inspiration-in-a-bottle).

* Who are the best current customers, with the highest LTV?
  * Knowledge Workers that can become dependent on the substance
  * People that are gullable and buy into fads. There is a reason people call the stuff programming.

  * All these individuals are human
  * The wikipedia article says nootropics work best on healthy people, but I bet unhealthy people would be more willing to buy them

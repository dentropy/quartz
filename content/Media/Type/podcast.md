Thinking
--------

I am really interested in Peters idea on the decline of peak innovation. Peter and Eric agree that on some scale society peaked in 1972/1973. The only exception is the world of bits which I would argue has also stagnated recently. Humanity's carrying capacity to space has gone down in the decades since Apollo. Cars and trains do not move any faster. Planes have also slowed down with the death of the Concorde.

Post on ThePortal Forumn
------------------------

Peter: Yes. I always think of the 1990s narrative was the new economy, and you lied about growth. And then the 2000s narrative was the Great Moderation, and you lied about volatility. And maybe the 2010s one is secular stagnation, where you lie about the real interest rates, because the other two don't work anymore. In sort of a complicated way, these things connect.

I find Peter's blerb where he says, "you lie about the real interest rates" to be pretty frightening. I follow Peter Schiff where on his podcast, back in the day, he would rant about how some institution here or there changed how they measure inflation to fit some sort of narrative then use the old calculation methods and prove the average american is now much poorer than they were in the past. Another figure Peter Schiff would talk about is how people are just dropping out of the workforce rather than looking for work and how that changed the unemployment rate. The puppet show is that everything is hunky dorry and Peter here is flat out saying people are getting poorer year over year.

## Quotes

“No one is really going to help you or give you direction. In fact, the odds are against you.”

“Become who you are by learning who you are.”

“Everything that happens to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.”

“The conventional mind is passive - it consumes information and regurgitates it in familiar forms. The dimensional mind is active, transforming everything it digests into something new and original, creating instead of consuming.”

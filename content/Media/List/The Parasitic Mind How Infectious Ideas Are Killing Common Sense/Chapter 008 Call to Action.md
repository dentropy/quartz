# Chapter 008: Call to Action
*   A deep friendship should be antifragile
*   “Men and women range themselves into three classes or orders of intelligence; you can tell the lowest class by their habit of always talking about persons; the next by the fact that their habit is always to converse about things; the highest, by their preference for the discussion of ideas.”
*   1) Mieux vaut être seul que mal accompagné \[Best to be alone than poorly accompanied\]; and 2) Dis-moi qui sont tes amis et je te dirai qui tu es \[Tell me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you who you are\].
*   Sam Harris Debating Burquas
    *   Person Sam is debtaing says that taking the eyes out of every third child is fine if that is what the religious ideology says is right
*   The difference between a judgmental ideologue and a judgmental intellectual is the process by which each arrives at his position.
*   The hash tags and Instagram profile pics display nothing
*   Mating Stratagies
    *   Survive, get food and avoid becoming someone else’s food.
    *   Fuck, those that evolve for intersexual wooing (the peacock’s tail; the “moonwalk” dance of the red-capped manakin) or for intrasexual competition (moose antlers; the cranial structure of rams for butting heads).
*   Astronaut Kevin Kelly having to apologize for quoting Winston Churchill, a man who lead the war against Hitler????
*   An individual who decides to wear a “Draw Mohammad” t-shirt in Yemen (to protest Islamic blasphemy laws) is undoubtedly exhibiting excessive fearlessness. On the other hand, the media’s reluctance to challenge an imam’s statement that “Islam is peace” is a manifestation of cowardice. Between these two endpoints lies the sweet spot of tempered and reasoned engagement.
*   Keep work and personal life separate, twitter exchanges should be separate just like parenting decisions
*   There is a dumbing down of society with MBA's requiring less and less work, grade inflation, and non disclosure of grades.
*   Socialism, “Great idea, Wrong species.”
*   It does no one any favors to pursue a utopian vision of society where no one’s feelings are hurt.

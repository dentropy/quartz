*   Summary
    *   From the perspective of Rearden
        *   Going to the party his wife is hosting for their Anniversary
        *   Thinks about how he has to wash off his business persona the same way people wash off machine grease after they get home
        *   Rearden blames himself whenever there is a problem at the mills (and life in general)
        *   Readen's family resents him for his passion for business
        *   The people at the party showcase examples of postmodernisim
        *   Lillian Rearden's wife invites people that speak out against Readen's company
*   Qutoes
    *   “Isn’t it generally agreed that an owner is a parasite and an exploiter”
    *   “"I’ve said in all my speeches that it’s not necessary to talk too much."”
    *   “By the standards of our time, the man who has the least to offer is the man who wins”
*   Why does this chapter have this name?
    *   This chapter has the name “THE NON-COMMERCIAL” because it speaks out against commerce

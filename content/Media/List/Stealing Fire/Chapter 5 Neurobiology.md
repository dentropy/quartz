# Chapter 5: Neurobiology
2021-01-25

The concept of changing ones state of consciousness through behaviour and thought change rather than using our ego to shape the world around is is like looking on label outside the jar. Botox changing ones facial expressions changes the persons experience of life. Rather than changing our environment in order to obtain state of consciousness we can change our states of mind. Our bodies do our thinking for us. There is this thing called Neuroethology that both empowers believes and atheists alike. There is a specific part of our brain that separates our body from the world around us and it can be broken and or turned off in a state of extasis. There are AI therapists that can measure ones mood. Transformational leaders not only regulated their own nervous systems better than most; they also regulated other peopleâ€™s.

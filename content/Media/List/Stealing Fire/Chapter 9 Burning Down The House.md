# Chapter 9: Burning Down The House
Best chapter so far.

What do I remember?

*   One can predict if someone is going to donate money to an anti bullying cause after listening to a heart wrenching story and listening to their body responses.
*   80% Extacis is a tool for control 100% is freedom building

Summary:

The CIA invented Brain Washing to get out of a situation in the Korean War. Information technologies start out as utopian and democratic and end up centralized and hegemonic. The government regulates the chemicals that cause non ordinary states, they do a shit job regulating the information technology that controls individuals states of mind and are about to. It is not a stretch for the government to regulate what does on in our literal minds and bodies, they go that for Olympic athletes…

Quotes:

Much in the same way that regimes used to declare certain books subversive, it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine a government declaring certain brain chemistry subversive. A telltale combination of neurotransmitters coursing through your bloodstream could be enough to get put on a watch list, or worse. The types of technology and methodologies used to attain extacis can be co opted for torturing people. The feds have infultrated Burrning Man. If you are going to deal with Extacis you better be responsible.

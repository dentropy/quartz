Interpretation
--------------

What is the nature of the self? The psyche is a pretty complicated thing that probably won't be codified any time soon.\* The universe is made of of lots of chaos. We are the universe experiencing itself, therefore we like the universe we are also made up of chaos. In order to navigate through the chaos of the world, society, and our lives our brains create contradictory heuristics without which we would not survive. For example as humans we usually like to forget we are animals and acknowledging this fact and all its eccentricities can lead to madness. Similar to natural selection one needs to understand the ideology they use to navigate the world and interact with others. Understanding the ideology of ones time requires understanding history and all its nuance. Braking down the chaos one can eventually arrive at the organizing idea, a dominant master drive that brings order to the chaos. Following this organizing idea one can spend their life striving towards Harmonious Totality.

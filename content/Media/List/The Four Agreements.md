When one is truly self aware they see everyone as a mirror. The mirror is always there but most people lack the self awareness to see it. This lack of self awareness is like a fog. The sociological imagination is made up of agreements we all have no choice in and were indoctrinated into. Seeing the mirror is more than self awareness though. Seeing the mirror is being meta aware. Being meta aware allows someone to see and eventually manipulate the agreements they made with the sociological imagination leading to self improvement. Seeing the agreements people have already made with themselves and highlighting them can potentially help them improve.

Humans are capable of self domestication, for example when someone cringes at something they did there is some pavlonian conditioning going on. This self domestication leads to many people hating themselves so other don't have to. This domestication makes people think they deserver abuse. This domestication is an agreement someone made with themselves.

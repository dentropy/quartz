## Summary

* When we think about picking up a fork it is actually God who moves our hand.
  * Seriously WTF, this is an amazing idea
* Is the world a delusion only existing as mental perceptions
* Having a body is something we can not jus imagine away
* Are we a mind equipt with a physical body or a complex organism that's gained consciousness over missions of years of evolution

I often feel unable to approach the infinite information. Instead of approaching it, I resort to dumping links into tiddlers so they pile up into a giant, teetering, rotting tower. As the stack grows higher, I feel even more unable to meet certain self-inflicted expectations of "keeping up" and "reading them all".

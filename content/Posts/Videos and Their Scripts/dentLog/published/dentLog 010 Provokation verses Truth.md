<!--
Take your fucking time bro
-->

What the fuck am I doing here? Not here as in the universe I have spent enough time trying to answer that in my previous videos, like here narrating in front of a stupid camera. I am quite literally having a fucking conversation with myself. Well if that's the trend let's see where that takes us.

Okay let's have a look at what I already said.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.001](Negotiation%20with%20the%20future)

What have you done with your life over the last 6 months bro?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.001](I%20want%20to%20use%20algorithms%20to%20enhance%20human%20agency%20while%20building%20infrastructure%20cypherpunks%20would%20admire.)

How exactly are you trying to measure agency. Can you even define the term agency off the top of your head? How do you differentiate between good types of agency and bad types of agency? And do cypherpunks even matter in a dataist world?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.001](Create%20an%20extendable%20map%20of%20the%20human%20experience)

Does that even mean anything?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.001](You%20like%20to%20talk%20about%20first%20principals.)

Did you even make your fucking bed in the morning.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.001](Let's%20create%20art%20with%20out%20lives.)

Alright cute phrase, I can masturbate to that

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.002](The%20Mind%20Body%20Problem.)

Worrying about that is totally going to help suicidal teens.

But dude you seriously need to finish reading that book on [wiki.concepts.list.Morphic Resonance](../../../../Wiki/Concepts/List/Morphic%20Resonance.md).


[posts.videos.dentLog.published.002](How%20do%20we%20best%20prepare%20for%20the%20final%20test%20of%20our%20character,%20the%20moment%20when%20we%20die?)

How about you start living you life as if you have 6 months to live, that should help solve your agency problem.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.002](We%20all%20must%20negotiate%20with%20the%20future)

Well that's what I am trying to do right now. Moving on.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.002](The%20parents%20must%20use%20their%20body%20to%20shape%20what%20the%20body%20of%20the%20child%20does.)

*pause* Parents.... or has that been replaced by the state???

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.002](we%20can%20share%20the%20strings%20to%20one%20another's%20body%20in%20our%20mutual%20quest%20to%20achieve%20the%20ideal%20future.)

Care to describe what these strings are?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.003](Living%20your%20life%20on%20an%20island%20LARPing%20being%20a%20technocrat.) 

Dude that is not a parody of what you are, that is exactly what you are.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.004](Feelings%20need%20to%20be%20induced%20controlled%20and%20accepted.) 

What are you trying to do bro, manipulate people?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.004](It%20is%20basically%20impossible%20for%20someone%20to%20be%20absolutely%20honest%20with%20another%20person.) 

That might be slightly based

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.004](Myths%20transform%20into%20a%20collective%20persona%20performed%20by%20a%20group%20of%20people)

What were you, a fucking poet?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.005](Our%20bodies%20are%20routers%20of%20energy)

Well that is one way to atomistically judge people.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.006](Rape%20still%20exists%20in%20our%20society%20for%20a%20reason.)

Are you trying to get yourself canceled bro. Some questions are better left unasked.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.006](What%20does%20it%20take%20to%20become%20the%20protagonist%20in%20your%20own%20life.)

Socratic dialog and the will to power.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.007](The%20only%20thing%20that%20exists%20is%20self%20preserving%20algorithms%20across%20time.)

Alright, do you consider that some sort of life advice or something?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.007](Asking%20where%20platos%20form%20come%20from?)

How about you go read some plato and find out for yourself.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.007](Git%20commits%20are%20a%20firm%20statement%20of%20one's%20perceived%20truth%20that%20must%20be%20built%20on%20or%20rejected%20by%20others.)

You gotta stop generating media in a vacuum bro.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.007](We%20need%20a%20coordinate%20system%20for%20the%20human%20experience.)

You gonna share any of that coolaid with anyone any time soon?

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.007](The%20Human%20Memeplex%20Project.)

Can you write more than a sentence when you propose something please.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.007](We%20need%20to%20provoke%20the%20truth%20out%20of%20people.)

Well sounds like you got some homework kid.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.008](Are%20you%20one%20of%20those%20self%20actualized%20fucks%20that%20can%20clearly%20articulate%20what%20makes%20me%20an%20idiot.)

These videos have like 10 views, zero comments, I guess I really am talking to myself.

[posts.videos.dentLog.published.009](I%20can%20only%20ring%20the%20bell%20if%20I%20live%20the%20correct%20life.)

Alright dentropy care to describe to me what "The Right Life" is?

Dude you need to stop masturbating to your own self importance and get a grip on your reality.

And if you really need to cum think about this,

There is no programing machines there is only programing other people.

Wow I just looked in the mirror and did not like what I saw.

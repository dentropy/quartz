Quest(ion) Engine is supposed to be the first component of the [dentropydaemon](../../../Wiki/Concepts/List/dentropydaemon.md) or the actualisation of the software used in [Daemon by Daniel Suarez](../../../Media/List/Daemon%20by%20Daniel%20Suarez.md). A statement in the form of software that makes us more human rather than less human. I am personally finding it harder and harder to relate to people. When I go out for dinner with people I used to know I find the conversation going in lame directions. I know if I ask the right questions I can get them going on passionate rants so they can sell me on their values and preferences. I don't know what these questions are and hope to use Quest(ion) Engine to find them. The goal is to have an emergent Quest Engine emerge from Quest(ion) Engine.

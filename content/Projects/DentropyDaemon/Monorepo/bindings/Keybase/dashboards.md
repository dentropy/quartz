## Dashboards

Currently, the **Dentropy Dashboards** page only contains tools for data interaction, visualization, and export related to the **[wiki.ddaemon.monorepo.bindings.keybase](../Keybase%20Binding.md)** project. This may change in the future as the scope of the project and associated tools grows. 

## Working Objective

To understand the objective motivating of any of these works, see the explanation **[here](https://wiki.dentropydaemon.io/en/dentropydaemon/semantic-forum)**.

## Internal Dashboards

* See **[wiki.ddaemon.monorepo.bindings.keybase.requests](Requests%20%20from%20Dentropy%20Daemon%20Keybase%20Team)** from **[Keybase-Binding](https://wiki.dentropydaemon.io/dentropydaemon/social-media-singularity/bindings/keybase)** team.

## [kumu.io](https://kumu.io)

> **[kumo](https://kumu.io)** is a promising platform that allows us to interface most of the data we have scraped from various pipelines to an interactive public-facing visual tool that promotes exploration and curation for "Human-in-the-Loop" analyses. Importantly, it updates dynamically via link to a Google `Sheets` table or a `json` object hosted elsewhere, and allows the user to export the data as `json` or `spreadsheet` if they would like a copy.
* [ideas](https://m053m716.kumu.io/ideas)
	+ Presentation with some indication of how text channel data could be used to "hook up" emergent ideas and trends using text channel interactions observed over the course of a weekend Hackathon event.

## [github.com](https://github.com)

> Most of the current code is hosted on the private Keybase team repository (2020-11-06).
* [Max's Github Pages site](https://m053m716.github.io)
  + Miscellaneous data visualization embeddings.
* [Max's public code repos](https://github.com/m053m716?tab=repositories)
  + Miscellaneous code, some of which might be useful in text analyses.

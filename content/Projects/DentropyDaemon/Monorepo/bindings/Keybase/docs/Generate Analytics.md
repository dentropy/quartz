### `GeneratedAnalytics` Class

> _Python3 class to organize different kinds of data from `Keybase` export._
> *Lives in [`generate_analytics.py`](generate_analytics.py).*

#### `GeneratedAnalytics` Properties

The properties of the `GeneratedAnalytics` class are maybe best to think of as "data reports." `GeneratedAnalytics` "reports" are refreshed by corresponding **[Methods](#generatedanalytics-methods)**.

# Generalized Pattern

{
"type" : STR
"title": STR
"x_axis": LIST of STR or INT
"y_axis": LIST of INT
"x_label": STR
"y_label": STR
}

### `Messages` Class ###

> _Python3 class that uses `sqlalchemy` to interface with `SQL` database._
> *Lives in [`database.py`](database.py).*

#### `Messages` Properties ####

Each `Messages` property can be thought of like a table column. They correspond to parts of the `.json` object returned by querying `Keybase` that we want to retain about each message, which includes transactions like "reactions" to other text chat messages, or users entering and leaving a channel.

##### `id` #####

```python
id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
```

Primary key identifier for each unique Message.

##### `team` #####

```python
team = Column(String(1024))
```

Which `Keybase` team was this message sent in?

##### `topic` #####

```python
topic = Column(String(128))
```

What Topic channel was this  message sent in?

##### `msg_id`

```python
msg_id = Column(Integer)
```

What message does this instance reference?

##### `msg_type`

```python
msg_type = Column(String(32))
```

What type of message (i.e. "text", "reaction", etc.) was this interaction?

##### `from_user`    

```python
from_user = Column(String(128))
```

From which user did this message originate?

##### `sent_time`    

```python
sent_time = Column(Integer)
```

What time was this message sent?

* *Note: this is the number of seconds, in posixtime convention (UTC). That is, the number of seconds elapsed since 1970.*

##### `txt_body`

```python
txt_body = Column(String(4096))
```

What text content was in the body of the message?

##### `word_count` #####

```python
word_count = Column(Integer)
```

How many words are in the body of the message?

###### TODO ######

- [ ] *Indicate how this was computed; are stop words included? etc.*

##### `num_urls`

```python
num_urls = Column(Integer)
```

How many URLs are referenced in this message?

##### `urls`

```python
urls = Column(String(4096))
```

What URLs were identified in this message?

###### TODO ######

- [ ] *Indicate how this was computed: are the URLs recognized on the Keybase end or on our side? From the code it looks like it is done on their end.*

##### `reaction_body`

```python
reaction_body = Column(String(1024))
```

If this is a reaction message, what emoji reaction was used in response to the message?

##### `msg_reference`

```python
msg_reference = Column(Integer)
```

If this message replies to (for `"text"`) or reacts to (for `"reaction"`), which message identifier does it reference?

##### `userMentions`

```python
userMentions = Column(String(1024))
```

What users were `@<user>` tagged in this message?

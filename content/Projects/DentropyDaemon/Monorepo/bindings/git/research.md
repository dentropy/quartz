## Notable Tools I researched along the way

* [Git log to json (git changelog nodejs) Â· GitHub](https://gist.github.com/sergey-shpak/40fe8d2534c5e5941b9db9e28132ca0b)
* [git-to-json - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-to-json)
  * Read your project's latest git commit info and write it to JSON
* [git-json-tree Â· PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/git-json-tree/)
* [git-log-to-json - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-log-to-json)
  * This is definitely the best tool so far
* Bash Script (What I implemented)
  * [Convert Git logs to JSON. The first script (git-log2json.sh) is all you need, the other two files contain only optional bonus features ðŸ˜€THIS GIST NOW HAS A FULL GIT REPO: https://github.com/context-driven-testing-toolkit/git-log2json](https://gist.github.com/textarcana/1306223)
    * Has nodejs bindings
  * [Git log in JSON format](https://gist.github.com/varemenos/e95c2e098e657c7688fd)
    * Almost works just has double quotes inside the JSON string without the escape character

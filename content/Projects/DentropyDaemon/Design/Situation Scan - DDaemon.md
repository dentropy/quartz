----------------

GUCCES - Goals - Users - Circumstance - Competition - Strategy

### Goals

* Create an implementation of [Tim Berners Lee\'s semantic web] that
    people could use as an with or as alternative to reddit, discord,
    youtube, forums, and wikis
* Build an open-source forum and knowledge-building software by using
    a semantic graph as its core structure.
* Define an ontology for productive conversation, which can also help
    the users to navigate and find information.
* Provide tools for effective and meaningful knowledge building and
    sensemaking
* Provide a client-side framework for writing components (or
    \"views\") that can display and change the graph.

    sensemaking
* Provide a client-side framework for writing components (or
    \"views\") that can display and change the graph.

### Users

* User groups
  * Knowledge Builders
    * Researchers, Teachers, Experts in their field, Have some
            sort of expertise
  * Maintainers / Cleaners
    * Enjoy learning and organizing knowledge. Edit quotes
            formatting and stuff, add links, add sources
  * Information Consumers
    * People that come to learn new things

### Circumstance

The world is made up of walled gardens that do not interact with one
another well. If there was a way to do more than just link the memes of
the world but categorize and label these links in complex ways it would
change the way humans and AI interact with the internet.

People are still learning how to interact with the internet. Most people
on the internet today are lurkers simply consuming content but with a
semantic forum people may want to interact more because they feel more
comfortable interacting online.

The walled gardens of the internet are causing a lot of censorship which
is a problem the semantic forum should be aware of.

Information many places can be too dense therefore people should be able
to see the map of memetic links that lead to the creation of said dense
information. After all [everything is a remix.]

### Competition

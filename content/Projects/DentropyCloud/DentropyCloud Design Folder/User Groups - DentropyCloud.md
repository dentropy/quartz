**There is a [user groups page in the wiki here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220426152016/https://deseng.ryerson.ca/dokuwiki/design:user_group) skim it. People fill different roles at different times. What are these roles, how do they work, do you know people that fit into these user groups, how do they interact with one another. Think about the flow of money and create a diagram. I have listed some user groups that come to mind, feel free to add or remove what I have.**

* Neo4J supports [wiki.concepts.list.Acronyms.ACID](../../../Wiki/Acronyms/ACID.md), transactional databases
* Key Value
* Document Databases
* Joins in SQL get complicated
* Graph databases store the relationships between our data
* Use Cases
  * Real Time Recommendations
    * Tones of different data points you can weigh
    * Walmart uses Neo4j
  * Master Data Management
    * Manages hierarchies for Cisco
  * Fraud Detection
    * Blockchain much!?!?!?!?
  * Graph Based Search
    * Neo4J started off with the founders developing a protocol.
    * Animal -> Gog -> Golden Doodle
  * Network and IT operations
    * Map out dependencies
    * Internet of THings dependencies and relationships
    * HP uses NEo4J to map network topologies
  * Identity and Access Management
    * User, Groups, Permissions
    * [wiki.concepts.list.Acronyms.AAA](../../../Wiki/Acronyms/AAA.md)
    * Security Audits using graph's
* [Neo4j GraphGists - graphgists](https://neo4j.com/graphgists/)
* Relationships are directional, can go both directions
* CSV and JSON dumps to Neo4J
* Offical support
  * JS, Java, Python, and .Net
* Bolt Protocol which is faster than HTTP
* Community Drivers
  * Go, Ruby, Rust
* Java Stored Procedures
  * Custom Jar Files
  * **APOC** library
    * Page Rank, Between This Centrality Clustering
  * You can query other databases from Neo4J using Java
* Queries that select every node in the graph do not work well on Neo4J
  * Use Spark or GraphX to do these types of queries, they work with Java Stored Procedures
* Find shortest path algorithms

* "Not graph tables a Graph theory graph, a network"
* Native graph database, not something on top of tables
* SQL is not built for highly connected data
* Cipher is SQL for graphs
* [Game Discovery: A Recommendation Algorithm for Video Games](https://neo4j.com/blog/video-game-discovery-recommendation-algorithm/)
* National Language Processing
* Graph's are everywhere
* [Hetionet - An integrative network of biomedical knowledge](https://het.io/)
* [Neo4j Sandbox | Online Graph Database â€“ No Download Required](https://neo4j.com/sandbox/)
* Graph's are everywhere but they do not belong everywhere
* Are you dealing with a highly connected data problem, then graph's are okay

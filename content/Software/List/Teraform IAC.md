  * Cool I can deploy a VPS in google cloud
  * Where do I get the credentials
  * How do I access the VPS after
  * How do I install stuff on the VPS with cloudinit or Teraform
  * How do I do backups and restore
  * What about databases
  * What about object storage

  * How is terraform different than [wiki.software.List.Ansible](Ansible.md)?
    * Terraform is about provisioning infrastructure while ansible is about configuration
    * Ansible is more mature than terraform
  * Terraform is all about version control management of your infrastructure, great for managing different environments such as development, testing, and production
  * Terraform takes two things into core
    * Terraform config, and terraform state
  * Providers are API plugins for Kubernetes, AWS, Azure Google Cloud etc....
  * Declarative vs Imperative
    * YOU DEFINE THE END STATE YOU DESIRE (Declarative)
    * Saying what to do would be an imperative approach
  * Terraform commands
    * refresh - get current state
    * plan - display changes required to get to desired state
    * apply - actually do the changes to get to the desired state
    * destroy - KILL EVERYTHING (Will also check what is running and make a plan)

  1. NEVER EDIT THIS FILE terraform.tfstate
    * JSON file
    * This file is created by `terraform apply`
  2. The terraform.tfstate file should be managed using remote storage for teams
  3. To avoid two people editing the state file use state locking
    * Not all S3 storage backends support this
  4. When you lost terraform.tfstate, remember to use version control, S3 has this built in
  5. Use one state file per environment
  6. GitOps, host terraform code in git
  7. Who is allowed to make changes to the terraform code, MERGE REQUESTS
  8. Use continuos integration

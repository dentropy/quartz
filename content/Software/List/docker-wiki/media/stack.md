This is the ultimate setup but it has too much for just a seedbox. It does torrent everything through a VPN though, so maybe I can just get a wireguard VPN rather than setting up a seedbox. Ya that would work and I can add that to my windscribe thing.

It is now obvious, we are running this one, there is no other choice that makes sense, it even uses windscribe like I am not lost for words.

We are going to spend 90 minutes on the weekend to get this up and running.

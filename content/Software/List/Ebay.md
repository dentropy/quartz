## Notes


To get production credentials you need to have a server up and running that ebay can contact.

Alright what domain do I want to use?

dentropycloud.xyz

How do we want to manage DNS?

We dockerize the thing using dentropycloud?

Really?

Sure why not

Running the nodejs code seems too complicated, thinking about running wordpress with special plugin.
